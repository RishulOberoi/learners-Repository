Long Slide,"Generative AI models have demonstrated an extraordinary capability to analyze vast amounts of data and create entirely new artifactsâ€”such as paintings, stories, or even molecular structures. The process begins with intensive training on huge datasets, where the AI identifies patterns that are often too subtle for human observers. These patterns are then used to generate content that not only mimics but sometimes surpasses the creativity of human experts. As companies continue to gather larger volumes of data, the applications of generative AI, from natural language processing to drug discovery, are poised for even greater breakthroughs. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the challenge lies in deploying these technologies ethically and safely.",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181671/pexels-photo-1181671.jpeg

summary,AI can revolutionize industries globally.,
Super Long Slide (Test Summarization),"Artificial intelligence, and specifically generative AI, has emerged as a defining technology in the 21st century, characterized by its unparalleled capacity to produce novel content and solve complex problems. By learning from exhaustively large and diverse datasets, these AI models have enabled a range of innovations, such as generating realistic images, composing symphonies, simulating conversations, and predicting the outcome of intricate scientific experiments. From academic research to business strategy, generative AI powers applications that were previously deemed impossible or impractical by human standards. As this field progresses, questions concerning automation, economic disruption, privacy, bias, and regulation are also becoming more urgent. The debate now centers not only on what machines can do, but what they should do, and how society can ensure the ethical deployment of these powerful tools for the collective good.",https://images.pexels.com/photos/373543/pexels-photo-373543.jpeg
